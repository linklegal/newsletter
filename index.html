Similarly, the LLP  Settlement Scheme, 2020, which was introduced pursuant to Circular No. 06/ 20  dated March 3, 2020 to reduce compliance burden on Limited Liability  Partnerships in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, was amended vide Circular No.  13/2020 dated March 30, 2020. <br />
        <br />
        Schemes act as one-time waivers by facilitating defaulting  companies and LLPs to make a fresh start as a fully complaint entity by  regularising past defaults in filings, irrespective of the duration of such  defaults. Both the schemes are applicable with effect from April 1, 2020 and  will continue till September 30, 2020. The pressing highlight of both the  schemes is that they significantly reduce the financial burden on entities  which could otherwise be saddled with considerable financial penalty,  especially if here are long-standing filing defaults.<br />
        <br />
        In  addition to the above, the MCA, has also allowed Director Identification Number (&ldquo;<strong>DIN</strong>&rdquo;)  holders of DINs marked as &lsquo;Deactivated&rsquo; due to non-filing of DIR-3KYC/DIR-3  KYC-Web and those companies whose compliance status has been marked as  &ldquo;ACTIVE non-compliant&rdquo; due to non-filing of Active Company Tagging Identities  and Verification (ACTIVE) e-form, to comply with the necessary filings with  no additional fees till September 30, 2020.</td>

The MCA has also amended the Companies  (Compromises, Arrangements and Amalgamations) Rules, 2016 and the National  Company Law Tribunal Rules, 2016 as a consequence of notifying sub-sections  (11) and (12) of Section 230 of the Act.<br />
          <br />
          Key highlights of the notified sections and  rules are as follows:<ol type="a">
            <li> A member or members of an unlisted company acting together, holding not less than 3/4th of the shares in the company, can make an application to the NCLT to buy out the minority shareholders holding the remaining shares.<br />
              <br />
              The term &ldquo;shares&rdquo; has been defined to mean  equity shares with voting rights including any securities, such as depository  receipts, which entitles the holder to exercise voting rights.<br />
              <br />
              Though the rules do not explicitly provide an  obligation on the part of the offeree minority shareholders to mandatorily sell  their shares, the scheme allows the shareholders with a 75% shareholding to  acquire the remaining minority shares, thereby intending a squeeze out of the  minority shareholders.<br />
&nbsp;            </li>
            <li>Such application is required to be accompanied  by a report from a registered valuer disclosing the valuation of the shares  after considering certain prescribed factors.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Prior to making such an application, the company  is required to open a separate bank account and deposit an amount not less than  ½ of total consideration of the proposed offer. </li>

          <br />
          As part of the ease of  doing business initiatives of the Government, the MCA has introduced a new  web-based Form SPICe+ (SPICe Plus), by replacing the existing Form SPICe for  incorporation of companies. This will be applicable for all new companies  incorporated on or after February 23, 2020. The Form SPICe+ is an integrated  single window web form that enables application for name reservation,  incorporation of company and DIN, PAN and TAN allotment, EPFO registration etc.  all under one form.<br />
          <br />
          Further, the existing AGILE  form has been renamed as form AGILE-PRO, which enables application to be made  for Profession Tax registration and opening of bank account at the time of  incorporation of a company. While applying for the aforesaid registration is  mandatory at the time of incorporation, users can also choose to apply for the  registration of Goods and Service Tax Identification Number.</td>

The MCA, vide this circular inter-alia clarifies that  IDs and NEDs should not be held liable or penalized for non-compliance of the  provisions of the Act unless the defaults/offences have occurred with their  knowledge or with their consent or by the reason of them not acting diligently  and brings in the concept that &ldquo;officers in default&rdquo; shall be such persons who  are responsible for the day-to-day management of the companies to whom specific  matters or authority has been given.<br />
            <br />
            The SOP aims to streamline the process of  prosecuting IDs/NEDs. The said circular <em>inter-alia</em> provides that for all  ongoing cases or cases where proceedings are to be initiated, the registrars should  follow the below standard operating procedures:
            <ol type="a">
              <li><strong>To  ascertain the nature of default in the company;</strong></li>
              <li><strong>To  ascertain who are the officers in default in the company, </strong>necessary  documents may be sought at the time of serving notices for inquiry or  investigation, for ascertaining the officers involved;<strong></strong></li>
              <li><strong>To  ascertain serving director or KMP </strong>as on the date of default, by  examining the records available with the Registrar, including e-Forms DIR-11 or  DIR-12, Annual Returns, Financial Statements to ascertain whether a particular  director or KMP was serving in the company on the date of  default;</li>
              <li><strong>Flings  of information and records with the RoC, maintenance of statutory and  secretarial records, compliance with the orders of statutory authorities</strong> to be responsibility of the WTDs and the KMPs. The responsibility of NEDs  ordinarily may arise only in case there is no WTD/KMP;</li>
              <li>Where  lapses are attributable to the decisions taken by the Board or its committees<strong>,  all care</strong> <strong>must be taken to ensure that civil /criminal proceedings are  not initiated</strong> against the IDs and NEDs unless there is <strong>sufficient  evidence</strong>; and</li>
              <li><strong>To  seek guidance from MCA on proceedings</strong>&nbsp;in case of  any doubts with regard to the liability of any person, for proceedings to be  initiated by the RoC, guidance may be sought from MCA (through the office of  the Director General of Corporate Affairs). Consequently, any such proceedings  must be initiated after receiving due sanction from the MCA.</li>
            </ol>
            MCA has directed all  registrars to implement the SOP with immediate effect, including in respect of  ongoing cases. Further, with respect to the cases which are already under  prosecution, but which do not meet the criteria mentioned in the circular, then  those cases should be submitted to MCA for necessary examination and further  direction thereon.</td>

            <em>The SOP clarifies that the imposition of  liability of the IDs and NEDs for various violations of the Act and acts as a  restriction on the powers of the Registrars thus safeguarding the IDs and NEDs.  However, the said SOP does not provide a blanket protection to the IDs  and NEDs and the same   needs to be assessed on a case to case basis. It has been prescribed  that all care must be taken to ensure that civil or criminal proceedings are  not unnecessarily initiated against the IDs or the NEDs unless sufficient  evidence exists to the contrary. The SOP is a principle-based approach and  requires registrars to understand the nature of default first and casts a  greater responsibility and obligations to examine relevant information on the RoCs  while dealing with any proceedings against them.</em><strong><br />
          <br />
          </strong><em>Though the said clarification is a welcome step,  the position of IDs and NEDs is still unclear under other statutes where there  is no change or relaxation in terms of liability that can be imposed, under  other statutes (Income Tax Act, 1961, the Prevention of Money Laundering Act,  2002, environmental legislations, the SEBI, etc.) and the IDs and NEDs are  still exposed to the risk of liability as these statutes do not carve-out such  exceptions for IDs/NEDs by virtue of their role in the company.</em></td>

              <li>Companies which have taken  deposit and total outstanding deposits does not exceed Rs. 25 lakhs; </li>

          <td style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:13px; color:#585858;">The Department for Promotion of Industry and  Internal Trade has issued Press Note No. 1 (2020 series) (<strong>&ldquo;Press Note&rdquo;</strong>)  dated February 21, 2020 amending the consolidated Foreign Direct Investment  Policy of 2017 (&ldquo;<strong>FDI Policy</strong>&rdquo;) by allowing 100% Foreign Direct Investment  (<strong>&ldquo;FDI&rdquo;</strong>) in insurance intermediaries. The Department of Economic Affairs  has thereafter issued a notification amending the relevant provisions of the Foreign  Exchange Management (Non-debt Instruments) Rules, 2019 on April 27, 2020 (<strong>&ldquo;Notification&rdquo;</strong>)  bringing the Press Note into effect.<br />
            <br />
            Insurance intermediaries include entities such  as insurance brokers, re-insurance brokers, insurance consultants, corporate  agents, third party administrators, surveyors, loss assessors, and such other  entities as may be notified by the Insurance Regulatory and Development  Authority of India (<strong>&ldquo;IRDAI&rdquo;</strong>). However, FDI in insurance companies  continues to be at 49% under the automatic route.<br />
            <br />
            The Notification, however, requires insurance  intermediaries that have majority shareholding of foreign investors to  undertake the following:
            <ol type="a">
              <li>be incorporated as a limited company under the Act;<br />
                &nbsp; </li>
              <li>at least one from among the chairman of the  board of directors or the chief executive officer or principal officer or  managing director of the insurance intermediary is required to be a resident  Indian citizen;<br />
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li>is required to take prior permission of IRDAI  for repatriating dividend;<br />
&nbsp;              </li>
              <li>is  required to bring in the latest technological, managerial, and other skills;<br />
              &nbsp;</li>
              <li>              is  not permitted to make payments to the foreign group or promoter or subsidiary  or interconnected or associate entities beyond what is necessary or permitted  by IRDAI; <br />
&nbsp;</li>
              <li>              is  required to make disclosures in the formats to be specified by IRDAI of all  payments made to its group or promoter or subsidiary or interconnected or  associate entities; and<br />
&nbsp;</li>
              <li>              is  required to ensure that the composition of the board of directors and key  management personnel meet the requirements specified by the concerned  regulators.</li>
          </ol>
          The Notification has also clarified that where  an entity like a bank whose primary business is outside the insurance area, is  allowed by IRDAI to function as an insurance intermediary, the foreign equity  investment caps applicable in that sector shall continue to apply, subject to  the condition that the revenues of such entities from the primary  (non-insurance related) business must remain above 50 per cent of their total  revenues in any financial year.</td>

            Following on from the  Notification, the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance <em>vide</em> order dated April 13, 2020 has specified Mauritius as an eligible country for  the purpose of registration as a Category I FPI, in response to the FATF  categorizing it under the grey list on February 21, 2020.</td>

SEBI/HO/CFD/DIL2/CIR/P/2020/13 dated January  22, 2020. The said amendments will not only reduce the timelines but will also  provide clarity on the renunciation and trading of rights entitlements.<br />
            <br />
            <strong><em>Mandatory  ASBA</em></strong><br />
            Earlier, renouncees were  required to invest only through the non-ASBA process which also involved  physical verification of forms. Now, all applications in rights issues are  mandatorily required to be done through the ASBA process.<br />
            <br />
            <strong><em>Record  date and advertisement</em></strong><br />
            Advance notice for record  date has been reduced from 7 (seven) working days (excluding the date of  intimation and the record date) to 3 (three) working days. Further, issuance of  newspaper advertisement disclosing date of completion of dispatch and  intimation of same to the stock exchanges for dissemination on their websites,  as per Regulation 84 (1) of ICDR Regulations, is now required to be completed  by the issuer at least 2 (two) days before the date of opening of the issue.<br />
            <br />
            <strong><em>Dematerialized  Rights Entitlement</em></strong><br />
            The concept of  dematerialized rights entitlement has been introduced. Companies undertaking a  rights issue are mandatorily required to credit the rights entitlement to  shareholders in demat form. SEBI has also introduced a legal framework for  renunciation of rights entitlement and has allowed trading of such rights  entitlement on the stock exchanges or transfer through off-market transactions,  confirming the existing market practice. Depositories and stock exchanges have  been directed to provide necessary procedure in this regard. Companies are  required to factor in time for those shareholders, who own shares in physical  form, to open demat accounts.<br />
            <br />
            However, credit of rights  entitlement to the demat account of shareholders who are resident in other  jurisdictions will require detailed analysis in view of offering restrictions  applicable under securities laws of other countries. In view of the existing  practice of reading laws of various jurisdictions harmoniously and the global  practice for rights offerings, crediting rights entitlements to shareholders  who are resident outside India will require further discussion.<br />
            <br />
            SEBI has also clarified  that the investors will not be allowed to withdraw their application after the  issue closing date.</td>
